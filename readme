(411RoughDraft.brd, 411RoughtDraft.sch) - status: complete - the 411roughDraft (.brd and .sch) are the original design files for our device. They are messy and error prone and do not hold any merit in the final design

(BOM.-Sheet1.pdf) - status: incomplete - Bill of Materials - has the appropriate quantity and compnents necessary for the PCB population but has yet to include the necessary materials needed for the container.

(BOM_Finalrev.xsl) - status complete - Bill of Materilas - up to date includes all necessary compoenents to be purchased.

(BankCode_rev1) - status: complete - The first complete rev for the arduino code used. Edit this to change the function of the microprocessor

(Childâ€™s Piggy Bank.pptx) - status: incomplete - Presentation for final project that has in detail on what we did step by step 

(CointControllerV1.brd, CointControllerV1.sch) - status: complete - The complete schematic and brd layout for the device. Send the .brd file in to be printed.

(Coin Sort Face v5.stl, Coin Sort Ramp v5.stl) - status: complete but untested. These files have the same dimensions as the laser cut acrylic sorter and should work but have not been 3d printed and tested.

(TestPlan.pdf) - status: assignment comp[lete - test documentation with descriptions. Minimal test case in accordance with the assignment.

(Coin Sorter (Sized) v1.f3d) - status: complete but untested. This is a working 3D CAD file for fusion 360. It has been optimized to use minimum material and fit in a small print bed. It will require extensive supports to print with SLA style printer and would be recommended to split at the intersection of the ramp before printing in that style 3D printer.

Programming instruction:
1) Flash the arduino bootloader onto the atmega328p. This can be done following the online tutorial found in this link: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ArduinoToBreadboard
2) Once the bootloader has been flashed you can solder the atmega328p to the board or insert it into a sleeve if you chose to purchase one.
3) Once the entire board is populated you can program the atmega328p with the BankCode_rev1 code. This can be done following the tutorial found at the same link as burning the bootloader. The difference in the connections is described below

Connections: (remember to remove the atmega328p from the arduinouno before programming)
  1) Arduino TX pin connects to pin5 of the 6x1 pin header
  2) Arduino RX pin connects to pin4 of the 6x1 pin header
  3) Arduino Vcc pin connects to pin2 of the 3x2 pin header
  4) Arduino gnd pin connects to pin6 of the 3x2 pin header
  5) Arduino reset pin connects to pin5 of the 3x2 pin header
  
 4) Once the wiring has been done upload the CoinCollector code to arduino as you normally would with the board selected being Arduino nano (atmega328p processor selected).
 5) The board should be ready to be wired up to the LCD screen and sensors. And you can begin the test procedure (see testProcedure.docx)
